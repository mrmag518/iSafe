* Supports 1.4.2

Version 3.23
* Added UseDetailedSearchMode option to Chat blacklist.
** This mode converts the whole sentence into one piece of word (removing all spaces). The censor will then check that string for any censored words.
* Added 'Whitelist' to the Chat blacklist.
** Let's say you have banned "penis" and have detailed search mode enabled. If Jens now tries to say 'pen is' he will be prevented. But if you writte 'pen is' in the whitelist list, he will be able to, but not 'penis'.
** This check have higher priority than the censor itself.
* Fixed possible message duplications in the Chat blacklist.

Version 3.22
* Made the date format files uses, more 'file friendly'.
* Removed old debug code in the command blacklist. (ups)
* Made fullbright detection message editable.
* Added various settings to the spam detector.
* Fixed typos in the Security config section. (-.-')
* Improved the spam detection significantly, it's now in decent function.
* Added two different spam detection modes.
** Normal mode. This check executes a new 1sec delayed scheduled task everytime a player executes a new sentence.
** Beast mode. This check executes at server start, or when isafe is reloaded. It executes a new 1sec repeating scheduled task. Everytime it executes it checks the spam database for every online player.
** I'm not entirely sure which of them who takes up most resources, but I would say normal mode uses most.
** I recommend using beast mode if you want a more logical 'punishment'. Just for an example, let's say Jens joins your server, and starts spamming with a rate at 1 sentence each 500ms, that's 2 sentences per second, that makes 1 more spam level added to the database each 500ms, the beastmode countdown only clears out one level each second. If Jens spammed for 10 seconds, he would need to wait 20 seconds to chat again.

Version 3.21
* Fixed fullbright notify sending out a permission notify.
* Added varius settings to fullbright prevention.
* Fixed grass not spreading.

* All blacklists have been completely recoded and revamped.
** There's now a much greater and possibility full multi-world support for blacklists.
** All blacklists except chat/censor & command blacklists now uses a much easier and understandable 'list' to choose disallowed blocks.
** To keep things cleaner, blacklists related to blocks/items only supports their ID, not name.
** Simple mistake corrector. Will correct, what probably will be 'common' editing mistakes.
** This update should improve the server's performance.
* Added KickPlayer option, and bypass permissions to the chat blacklist.
* What the.. Sorry for bucket issues.. some wierd noob mistake I've done, ugh.
* Fixed sprint & sneak issues.
* Added a very simple spam check.
** This check is under development, if you have a better alterantive, you should use that at the moment.
** This spam check will individually support command spam later.
* Cleanup with the update notify.
* Fixed, if using Vault for permission, blacklists would send out a duplicated no permission message.
* Fixed commands not using the proper permission method, leading to Vault support not working properly.
* Added command /isafe resetfile <file>.
** This will reset the specefic file to it's default settings.

** Prevent pistons from extending, if the intended row contains a blacklisted block.
* Fixed a little typo related to enchantments.
* Fixed enchantment permissions to use the new bypass category.
* Did a hacky "fix" for users using EssentialsProtect to handle explosions.
